Github User and Organization websites are described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user-and-organization-pages-sites)

!!! info "User and Organization Details"

    * MkDocs content is kept in *org-name-mkdocs* repo
    
    
## Website Deployment
* User and Organization websites use two repos: one for the MkDocs content and the other for the website output, e.g.,
`org-name-mkdocs` and `org-name.github.io`
* The site is built with: 
```
cd ../org-name.github.io; mkdocs gh-deploy --config-file ../org-name-mkdocs/mkdocs.yml --remote-branch master
```
* The site content is pushed to the *org-name.github.io* repo's *master* branch 
* The [Makefile](https://github.com/romaicus/mkdocs-demo/blob/master/Makefile) in this 
[repo](https://github.com/romaicus/mkdocs-demo) has a target for building the site
